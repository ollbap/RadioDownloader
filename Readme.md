# RadioDownloader
Each day downloads a radio stream in to a mp3 file than can then be played with external player, like vlc.

The download is resumed after connection is lost (like when network is changed) but will not continue if active network is metered.

# TODO
 * Allow times to be configured
 * Allow radios to be configured
 * Allow ignore metered networks restrictions for one execution
